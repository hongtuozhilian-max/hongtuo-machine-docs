# HL-800F – Structure and Working Logic

## Overall Structure
The HL-800F is a remote-controlled flail mower designed for
safe and efficient operation on slopes and rough terrain.

The machine consists of the following main systems:
- Power system
- Drive and track system
- Cutting system
- Hydraulic lifting system
- Remote control system
- Safety protection system

## Power System
The machine is powered by a diesel engine.
Engine output is transmitted to:
- The cutting system
- The hydraulic system
- The drive motors

This design ensures stable torque output during heavy-duty mowing.

## Drive and Track System
The tracked chassis provides:
- High traction on slopes
- Low ground pressure
- Stable operation on uneven terrain

Each track is driven independently, allowing precise turning
and controlled movement on steep areas.

## Cutting System
The cutting system uses vertical flail blades mounted on a
high-speed rotating shaft.

Key characteristics:
- Efficient cutting of high grass and rough vegetation
- Reduced blade damage when contacting small obstacles
- Even cutting performance on uneven ground

## Hydraulic Lifting System
The cutting deck height is adjusted via a hydraulic lifting system
controlled by the remote controller.

This allows the operator to:
- Adapt cutting height to terrain conditions
- Avoid ground contact on uneven surfaces
- Improve overall cutting efficiency

## Remote Control System
The machine is operated via an industrial wireless remote control.

Main control functions include:
- Forward / backward movement
- Left / right turning
- Cutting system on / off
- Cutting height adjustment
- Emergency stop

## Safety Design
The HL-800F is designed to keep the operator at a safe distance
from hazardous areas.

Safety features include:
- Remote operation outside the danger zone
- Low center of gravity for slope stability
- Emergency stop function for immediate shutdown
